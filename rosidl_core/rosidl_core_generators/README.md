# rosidl_core_generators

Provides CMake functionality for finding and adding buildtime dependencies for packages providing ROS message definitions.

## Features

The *features* of this package consist entirely of serving as a gathering place for all runtime related dependencies of ROS interface packages.
These dependencies can be found in the [package.xml](package.xml).
This helps reduce the boilerplate needed when developers create their own interface packages.
