# rosidl_core

Provides buildtime and runtime dependencies for ROS messages.

- [rosidl\_core\_generators](rosidl_core_generators/README.md) brings together dependencies for generating and building code for ROS messages.
- [rosidl\_core\_runtime](rosidl_core_runtime/README.md) brings together dependencies for using ROS messages at runtime.

For dependencies required for ROS services and ROS actions, you should depend on [rosidl_defaults](https://github.com/ros2/rosidl_defaults).
